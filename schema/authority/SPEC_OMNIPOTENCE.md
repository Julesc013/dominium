# SPEC OMNIPOTENCE (OMNI0)

Status: draft.
Version: 1.0
Scope: omnipotence semantics and constraints.

## Omnipotence Definition
Omnipotence is the union of all authority layers, still bound by:
- intent -> law gate -> effect
- audit requirements
- existence and archival invariants

## Constraints
- No direct mutation without effects.
- History edits require fork (EXIST2).
- All overrides are explicit and auditable.

## Integration Points
- Law targets for override intents
- Audit logging and explanation
