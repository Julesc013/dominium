PURPOSE:
- Define standards, certifications, and tolerance frameworks.

STABILITY GUARANTEES:
- Required fields MUST exist.
- Records are open maps; unknown fields MUST be preserved.
- No field removal or renaming without a MAJOR version bump.
- Identifiers are stable and MUST NOT be reused with new meaning.

NON-SEMANTICS:
- Standards do NOT imply legal enforcement by themselves.
- Certification rules are declarative only.

CONVENTIONS:
- id: stable namespaced string; opaque.
- tag: namespaced string; unknown values allowed.
- map: open key/value map; unknown keys preserved.

REQUIRED SHAPE:
record standard
  required:
    - standard_id: id
    - scope: tag
    - tolerance_ranges: map
    - certification_rules: map
    - authority_ref: authority_ref
    - unit_annotations: map
    - extensions: map

TYPE DEFINITIONS:
record authority_ref
  required:
    - authority_id: id
  optional:
    - qualifier_tags: [tag]
    - metadata: map

MIGRATION:
- Transform-only migrations are permitted via versioned transforms.
- Old data MUST NOT be reinterpreted without explicit transformation or refusal.

UNIT POLICY:
- All numeric values MUST reference a unit tag from `docs/arch/UNIT_SYSTEM_POLICY.md`.
- Overflow behavior MUST be declared (refusal on overflow).
