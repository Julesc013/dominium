# SPEC ASYMMETRIC TIME (TIME3)

Status: draft.
Version: 1.0
Scope: multiple observer clocks with different perception windows.

## Definition
Observers may have different:
- dilation_factors
- buffer windows
- replay modes

## Constraints
- Authoritative outcomes remain identical.
- Observers cannot influence causality without authority.
- Perception differences are auditable.

## Determinism Rules
- Observer mappings are deterministic given inputs.
- No cross-observer influence on ACT.

## Integration Points
- TIME2 observer clocks and dilation
- TIME3 perception buffers and replay modes
- Law/capability limits
