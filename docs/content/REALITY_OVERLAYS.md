# Reality Overlays

Real-world overlays are OPTIONAL packs that refine procedural truth. They do
not replace or rewrite baseline truth, and they MUST never be assumed as
defaults.

## Binding rules
- Overlays MUST target explicit topology nodes or scoped domains.
- Overlays MUST use refinement plans and declared model families only.
- Overlays MUST carry provenance, confidence, and uncertainty metadata.
- Overlays MUST respect refinement ceilings and explicit LOD bounds.
- Overlays MUST be removable without corrupting saves or replays.

## What overlays do
- Provide anchor facts and constraints for a specific target.
- Improve macro-scale alignment with observational data.
- Preserve procedural refinement below declared ceilings.

## What overlays do NOT do
- They do NOT introduce realism into the engine.
- They do NOT define procedural algorithms.
- They do NOT grant authority or bypass capability checks.
- They do NOT override objective truth outside their scope.

## Examples
- Milky Way overlay refines one galaxy node with structural anchors.
- Sol overlay refines one star system with macro ephemerides.
- Earth macro overlay refines a single body with coarse terrain and climate.
