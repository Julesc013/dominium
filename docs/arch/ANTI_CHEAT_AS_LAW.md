# Anti-Cheat as Law (OMNI0)

Status: draft.
Scope: anti-cheat enforcement through law and capabilities.

## Principle
Anti-cheat is expressed as law + negative capabilities, not special cases.

## Examples
- DENY_MODIFIED_CLIENTS
- DENY_EXTERNAL_TOOLS
- DENY_TIME_MANIPULATION

## Rules
- All powerful actions require capability targets.
- All enforcement is auditable.
- No hard-coded admin or cheat flags.
