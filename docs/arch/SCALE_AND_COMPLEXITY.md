# Scale and Complexity (FUTURE0)

Status: binding.
Scope: why the system scales without simulating everything all the time.

Dominium scales by refusing global work. Macro state is authoritative; micro
detail is realized only when needed and lawfully refinable.

## Why nothing simulates everything
- Simulation advances by scheduled effects, not global ticks.
- Domains bound computation and jurisdiction.
- Refinement is contract-driven and interest-based.
- Absence is valid; systems must function with zero agents or zero economy.

## Macro to micro
Macro models track totals and rates. Refinement realizes micro detail only when
observed, interacted with, or required by law. Collapse aggregates micro state
back into macro deterministically.

## Global iteration is forbidden
Any system that requires scanning all entities each tick is invalid. All work
must be queued, scheduled, or targeted by explicit references.

## Scale scenarios (explicit)
- Millions of players: interest and domain partitioning bound per-shard work.
- Trillions of agents (macro): macro cohorts exist without per-agent updates.
- Galaxy or universe scale: domains and travel edges bound reachability.
- AI-only autorun worlds: perception acceleration advances macro state only.
- Single-room puzzle worlds: refinement can remain micro at all times.
