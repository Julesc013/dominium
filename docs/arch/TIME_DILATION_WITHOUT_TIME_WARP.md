# Time Dilation Without Time Warp (TIME2)

Status: draft.
Scope: perception effects without ACT modification.

## Model
Perceived time is a deterministic mapping of ACT:
- monotonic
- continuous
- derived only

## Buffering
Observers may view ACT - delta within bounded windows:
- read-only unless authority permits
- no future leakage beyond max_lead

## Governance
Law and capability may:
- limit dilation factors
- forbid buffering
- require audit for overrides

## Denial Outcomes
- TIME_VIEW_ACCEPT
- TIME_VIEW_CLAMP
- TIME_VIEW_REFUSE
