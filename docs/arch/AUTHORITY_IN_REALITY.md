# Authority in Reality (REALITY0)

Status: binding.
Scope: how power interacts with existence, space, time, and visitability.

There are no game modes. There are only laws and capabilities. Spectator to
god-mode behavior is data configuration, not special code paths.

## Authority layers (OMNI0)
Canonical authority layers:
- SIMULATION
- TEMPORAL
- SPATIAL
- EPISTEMIC
- GOVERNANCE
- EXECUTION
- INTEGRITY
- ARCHIVAL

Layers are schema-defined; capabilities are additive and scoped.

## Authority rules
- All power flows through law-gated effects.
- Capabilities allow attempts; law decides outcomes.
- Omnipotence is additive capability, not bypass.
- Archived history is immutable; changes require explicit forks.

## Reality interactions (examples)
Spectator volume:
- EPISTEMIC allow, SIMULATION deny.
- Read-only, law-gated access; no mutation.

Competitive lockdown:
- Deny modified clients and tool intents.
- Law enforces strict capability scopes and audit.

Anarchy frontier:
- Broad capability grants within a domain.
- Still no existence or archival bypass.

Admin chamber:
- Scoped omnipotent capability inside a domain.
- Requires explicit effects and audit for any mutation.
