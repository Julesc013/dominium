# What This Project Is Not (CANON0)

Status: binding.
Scope: guardrails against common misunderstandings.

## Not a traditional game engine
It is not a generic rendering or physics framework; rendering is derived and
authoritative logic is deterministic and law-gated.

## Not a tick-everything sandbox
No global scans or per-tick AI loops; simulation advances via scheduled events.

## Not a physics-everywhere simulator
Micro detail is refined only when required; macro existence is valid.

## Not a modes-based game
There are no hard-coded modes; laws and capabilities define behavior.

## Not a cheat-based admin system
Admin power is capability- and law-gated, audited, and fork-aware.

## Not a single-scale simulation
It supports macro-only, meso, and micro refinement with explicit contracts.
