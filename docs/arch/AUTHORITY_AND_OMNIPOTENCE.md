# Authority and Omnipotence (OMNI0)

Status: draft.
Scope: canonical authority model and omnipotence constraints.

## Core Principles
- All power is granted via capabilities.
- All restriction is enforced via law.
- All overrides are explicit effects and auditable.
- No hard-coded admin or cheat flags.

## Authority Layers
Authority is decomposed into independent layers:
- simulation, temporal, spatial, epistemic
- governance, execution, integrity, archival

## Omnipotence
Omnipotence is additive and still constrained by:
- intent -> law gate -> effect
- audit requirements
- fork-required history edits
