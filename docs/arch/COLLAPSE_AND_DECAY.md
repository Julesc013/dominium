# Collapse and Decay (CIV0+)

Status: binding.
Scope: canonical failure modes for civilizations and economies.

Civilizations can fail. Collapse is gradual, auditable, and consistent with
resource, infrastructure, and legitimacy constraints. There is no reset
mechanic.

## Natural failure modes
- Infrastructure decay when maintenance fails.
- Resource depletion or logistics breakdown.
- Legitimacy collapse and enforcement failure.
- Population decline via explicit death and migration.
- Market contraction or exchange refusal.

## Collapse characteristics
- Gradual: decay occurs over scheduled ACT intervals.
- Auditable: all changes are explicit effects with provenance.
- Persistent: ruins and remnants remain until removed by explicit effects.

## Macro and micro consistency
Macro decline must be reflected in refined micro outcomes. If macro capacity
collapses, micro systems must show scarcity, outages, and degraded services.
