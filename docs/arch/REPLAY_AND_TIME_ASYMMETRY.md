# Replay and Time Asymmetry (TIME3)

Status: draft.
Scope: unified model for replay and asymmetric time perception.

## Single Model
Replay, spectating, and time asymmetry share one model:
- observer clocks map ACT to perceived time
- perception buffers bound what can be seen
- replay modes constrain interaction

## Asymmetric Time
Different observers may have different:
- dilation factors
- buffer windows
- replay modes

Authoritative outcomes remain identical.

## Integration
- Fog-of-war and comm latency apply to buffered perception.
- Law and capability gates constrain access and modes.
- Admin views are audited and read-only unless authority allows.
