# Glossary (ARCH0 Binding)

Engine: Mechanisms only; deterministic substrate and runtime systems.
Game: Meaning and authoritative rules built on engine public API.
Module: A composable system with declared invariants and dependencies.
System: A running instance of a module.
Law: A rule governing existence or action; evaluated by the law kernel.
Policy: A constraint on permitted action (rates, scopes, windows).
Capability: An additive permission required to attempt actions.
Authority: Effective power derived from capabilities plus law outcomes.
Intent: A request to do something; admitted by law before execution.
Event: A scheduled state transition on ACT.
Effect: The result of an event; authoritative or derived.
Refusal: A law output that denies an action with explanation and audit.
ACT: Authoritative simulation time; monotonic and never warped.
Existence state: Explicit state of a subject (NONEXISTENT..ARCHIVED).
Refinement: Deterministic realization of micro state from macro state.
Domain: A spatial volume that bounds where reality exists and laws apply.
Visitability: Reachability plus refinable existence and a valid contract.
Work IR: Declarative representation of authoritative tasks.
Access IR: Declarative representation of read/write/reduction access.
Derived: Non-authoritative computation that must not affect truth.
