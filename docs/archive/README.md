# Docs Archive (Archived)

Status: archived.

This directory contains historical documentation and superseded drafts.
Archived documents are retained for provenance and audit trails only.

Canonical contracts live under `docs/architecture/`. New work must not be
added here unless it is explicitly archived with a replacement link.
