# COMPAT_TERMS — Legacy Terminology Mapping

## Purpose
This document maps legacy terms to canonical terminology to keep specs and docs
consistent.

## Mappings
- Universe directory → Universe bundle
- Star system → Cosmo system anchor
- Physics → Logical mechanics unless explicitly local

## Rules
- Prefer canonical terms in new docs and code comments.
- When updating legacy docs, replace mapped terms where possible.
