# Dominium Community and Contributor Conduct Policy  
### Version 1.0

This document defines the behavioural expectations for all contributors, participants, maintainers, and collaborators interacting with the Dominium project, including issues, pull requests, discussions, documentation, tooling, and future community spaces.

Dominium is a technical project with strict determinism, architectural discipline, and long-term maintainability requirements.  
A clear conduct policy ensures that engineering work remains focused, respectful, and productive.

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including (but not limited to):

- GitHub Issues and Pull Requests  
- Code reviews  
- Documentation discussions  
- Design debates  
- Official forums, chats, or Discord (when available)  
- Mailing lists or private coordination channels

# 1. CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1.1 Respect  
Treat all contributors with respect regardless of background, experience, or level of technical knowledge.

### 1.2 Technical Rigor  
Disagreements should be handled through evidence-based, technical reasoning, not personal critique.

### 1.3 Professionalism  
Maintain a professional tone.  
Hostility, sarcasm used as attack, or personal insults are not permitted.

### 1.4 Focus  
All discussion must remain productive and relevant to the goals of Dominium.

### 1.5 Inclusivity  
Anyone may participate if they follow this Code of Conduct, regardless of skill level or expertise.

### 1.6 No Gatekeeping  
Correct behaviour is enforced by adherence to standards, not personal power dynamics.

# 2. POSITIVE BEHAVIOURS EXPECTED

Contributors are expected to:

- Write clear, concise, technically grounded comments  
- Provide rationales in discussions and code reviews  
- Accept constructive criticism  
- Help new contributors understand architectural rules  
- Ask for clarification when specifications are unclear  
- Keep discussions factual and objective  
- Prioritise correctness over ego  
- Follow repository structures and deterministic guidelines  

---

# 3. UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOUR

Any of the following constitutes a violation:

## 3.1 Harassment or Abuse  
- Insults, threats, or demeaning language  
- Targeting individuals or groups  
- Racist, sexist, or otherwise discriminatory behaviour  

## 3.2 Disruption  
- Persistently derailing discussions  
- Flooding issues or PRs with off-topic content  
- Repeatedly ignoring architectural or determinism rules  

## 3.3 Aggressive Language  
- Hostility in code reviews  
- Mocking contributors  
- Dismissing others without explanation  

## 3.4 Demands or Entitlement  
- Forcing maintainers to accept contributions  
- Pressuring others for immediate responses  

## 3.5 Retaliation  
Retaliation against individuals who raise concerns or enforce the Code is strictly prohibited.

# 4. PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT IN TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS

### 4.1 Assume Good Faith  
Unless proven otherwise, assume contributors are trying to help.

### 4.2 Separate People from Problems  
Critique the code, not the developer.

### 4.3 Evidence-Backed Arguments  
Claims must be supported by:

- Specification references  
- Determinism constraints  
- Architectural diagrams  
- Benchmarks or test results  

### 4.4 Technical Objectivity  
Avoid emotional or ideological reasoning.  
Decisions must follow engine philosophy and spec requirements.

---

# 5. MAINTAINER RESPONSIBILITIES

Maintainers must:

- Enforce this Code consistently  
- Review contributions fairly and impartially  
- Explain rejections clearly and with rationale  
- Escalate serious violations promptly  
- Protect the integrity of the engine architecture  

Maintainers may reject contributions on architecture or determinism grounds alone, even if behaviour is acceptable.

---

# 6. REPORTING VIOLATIONS

Violations may be reported through:

- GitHub private reports  
- Direct email to maintainers (will be published on official release)  
- Private messages in approved channels (Discord, etc.)  

Reports must include:

- Description of behaviour  
- Links or screenshots  
- Optional suggestions for resolution  

Reporters may remain anonymous.

---

# 7. ENFORCEMENT

### 7.1 Minor First-Time Violations  
Handled with a private or public reminder of expected behaviour.

### 7.2 Repeated Violations  
May result in:

- Temporary muting  
- Temporary exclusion from discussions  
- Rejection of contributions until behaviour improves  

### 7.3 Severe Violations  
May result in:

- Permanent ban from project participation  
- Removal of collaborator or maintainer privileges  
- Escalation to platform administrators (GitHub, Discord, etc.)

### 7.4 No Public Shaming  
Enforcement actions are private unless the violator chooses to publicise them.

---

# 8. APPEALS

Anyone subject to an enforcement action may file an appeal to the maintainers.  
Appeals must:

- Clearly explain why the decision was incorrect  
- Provide context or evidence not previously considered  
- Demonstrate commitment to future compliance  

The maintainers’ decision on appeals is final.

---

# 9. SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS

This Code of Conduct applies only to official Dominium spaces.  
Unofficial or third-party communities are outside its jurisdiction.

Maintainers cannot enforce rules outside the project environment.

---

# 10. MODIFICATION

The maintainers may update this Code of Conduct as the community grows.  
Any change must:

- Be documented in `CHANGELOG.md`  
- Be consistent with the project’s philosophy  
- Improve clarity and accountability  

---

# 11. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This Code of Conduct incorporates principles from:

- Contributor Covenant  
- Rust Code of Conduct  
- LLVM Conduct Guidelines  
- Internal engineering culture guidelines  

Adapted to Dominium’s architectural and determinism-driven environment.

---

# 12. FINAL NOTE

Dominium aims to be a technically rigorous, respectful, and future-proof project.  
We maintain high expectations for behaviour because:

- The engine is complex  
- Collaboration requires clarity  
- Determinism requires discipline  
- The project must remain maintainable for decades  

By participating, you agree to uphold these standards.
