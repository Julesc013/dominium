# PLAYER AUTHORITY

Players MAY act only through explicit authority tokens and capability sets.
Authority MUST be granted and revoked by processes and MUST be auditable.
Players MUST NOT bypass authority checks, epistemic limits, or physical constraints.

Debug/admin control MUST be explicit, capability-gated, and non-default.
