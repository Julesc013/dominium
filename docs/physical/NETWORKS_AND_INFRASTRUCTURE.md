# NETWORKS AND INFRASTRUCTURE

All infrastructure MUST use a unified network graph model (nodes, edges, capacity, loss).
Network operations MUST be process-mediated and deterministic.
Overload MUST fail locally and may cascade only through explicit processes.
Infrastructure availability MUST constrain agent capabilities.

Infrastructure MUST NOT assume modern human utilities or Earth-specific tech stacks.
Infrastructure MUST NOT rely on "AI magic" or hidden routing rules.
