# FAILURE AND MAINTENANCE

Wear, fatigue, corrosion, and catastrophic failure MUST be first-class processes.
Failure MUST emit events, alter future planning, and require repair or replacement.
Maintenance MUST be explicit, time- and resource-bound, and authority-gated where applicable.

Failure systems MUST NOT assume human maintenance practices or "AI magic" recovery.
Failure systems MUST NOT permit silent retries or hidden repairs.
