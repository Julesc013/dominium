# No Magic Teleports (TRAVEL2)

Status: draft.
Scope: explicit prohibition of implicit exotic movement.

## Rule
No code path may change location without an explicit TravelEdge and scheduled
travel effects.

## Exotic Travel
Portals, wormholes, hyperspace, and jump gates are explicit edges with:
- declared traversal mode
- explicit traversal time (including zero)
- capacity and cost
- law and capability constraints

## Audit
All exotic travel must be auditable and deterministic.
