# Collapse and Decay (CIV0+)





Status: binding.


Scope: canonical failure modes for civilizations and economies.





Civilizations can fail. Collapse is gradual, auditable, and consistent with


resource, infrastructure, and legitimacy constraints. There is no reset


mechanic.





## Invariants


- Collapse is gradual and scheduled on ACT.


- All decay is auditable and provenance-preserving.


- Ruins persist until explicitly removed.





## Natural failure modes


- Infrastructure decay when maintenance fails.


- Resource depletion or logistics breakdown.


- Legitimacy collapse and enforcement failure.


- Population decline via explicit death and migration.


- Market contraction or exchange refusal.





## Collapse characteristics


- Gradual: decay occurs over scheduled ACT intervals.


- Auditable: all changes are explicit effects with provenance.


- Persistent: ruins and remnants remain until removed by explicit effects.





## Macro and micro consistency


Macro decline must be reflected in refined micro outcomes. If macro capacity


collapses, micro systems must show scarcity, outages, and degraded services.

- Legitimacy: `schema/civ/SPEC_LEGITIMACY.md`


- Economy: `docs/architecture/ECONOMY_AND_LOGISTICS.md`





## Forbidden assumptions


- Civilizations can be reset without explicit effects.


- Collapse can be skipped for convenience.
