# Exotic Travel and Reality (TRAVEL2)





Status: draft.


Scope: exotic travel is explicit, deterministic, and auditable.





## Rule


All portals, wormholes, hyperspace corridors, and jump gates are explicit


TravelEdges with declared traversal semantics.





## Zero-Time Travel


Zero-time traversal is allowed only if explicitly declared and scheduled.


It does not bypass:


- law and capability checks


- capacity and cost


- visitability and refinement


- shard message ordering





## Domain and Visitability


Exotic travel must respect:


- domain permissions at source/transit/destination


- visitability checks on arrival


- archival and forking rules





## Denials


Denials are explicit and auditable:


- EXOTIC_EDGE_DISABLED


- CAPABILITY_MISSING


- DOMAIN_FORBIDDEN


- DESTINATION_ARCHIVED


- DESTINATION_NOT_VISITABLE


- CAPACITY_EXCEEDED
