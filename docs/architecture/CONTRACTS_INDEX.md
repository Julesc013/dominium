# Contracts Index (CONST0)





Status: binding.


Scope: index of frozen and evolving constitutional surfaces.





This index is the navigation hub for stability surfaces. "FROZEN" means the


document defines a contract that must not change lightly. "EVOLVING" means the


document is binding but still expected to grow or sharpen.
