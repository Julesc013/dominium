# Reality Model (CANON0)





Status: deprecated.


Scope: historical summary of existence, refinement, domains, travel, time, and authority.





Deprecated by `docs/architecture/REALITY_LAYER.md` (REALITY0) to consolidate the Reality


Layer into a single canonical model with explicit flow and visitability rules.


This document remains as a snapshot but is no longer authoritative.





This document consolidates the canonical reality model so contributors do not


need to stitch it together from dozens of files.





## Canonical primitives


- Existence states and lifecycle (EXIST0/EXIST2).


- Refinement and collapse contracts (EXIST1).


- Domain volumes and jurisdiction binding (DOMAIN0/DOMAIN2).


- Travel graph edges and scheduling (TRAVEL0/TRAVEL1).


- Visitability (DOMAIN4).


- ACT and observer clocks (TIME2/TIME3).


- Authority layers, capabilities, and law kernel (OMNI0).





## Reality chain (authoritative)


1) Existence is explicit: a subject has an existence_state.


2) Domain volumes bound where it exists and which jurisdictions apply.


3) Travel graph edges define reachability; movement is scheduled on ACT.


4) Visitability requires REFINABLE or REALIZED state plus a contract.


5) Refinement realizes micro detail; collapse preserves truth and provenance.


6) Observer clocks derive perception without changing ACT.


7) Law and capability gates apply to every intent, task, and effect.





## How can something exist, be alive, yet not be simulated at micro scale?


Existence is orthogonal to fidelity. A subject may be LATENT or REFINABLE with


macro-level state, conservation, and provenance intact. It is "alive" because


its macro contracts are valid and it can be refined deterministically when


needed. Micro simulation is optional and contract-driven, not assumed.





## How can a player reach something only if it is refinable?


Arrival requires visitability. Visitability requires reachability plus a


REFINABLE or REALIZED existence state and a valid refinement contract. If the


contract is absent or budgets deny refinement, the system must defer or refuse.


There is no path to a non-refinable destination.





## How can AI civilizations exist for millennia without CPU burn?


AI civilizations can remain LATENT or REFINABLE while advancing via coarse,


event-driven updates and scheduled macro effects. Refinement happens only when


visitability or explicit interest demands micro detail. No per-tick global loops


are required.





## How can god-mode exist without corrupting history?


Omnipotence is still routed through the same intent -> law -> effect pipeline,


with audit records and provenance. Archived history is immutable; edits require


explicit fork effects. There is no silent bypass for history mutation.
