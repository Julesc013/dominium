# Why NPCs Don't Pop (LIFE0+)

Status: binding.
Scope: explain why NPC pop-in/out is forbidden by design.

NPCs do not pop into existence or vanish without cause. The life model enforces
explicit birth/death, refinement, and identity continuity.

## Why pop-in is forbidden
- Life entities require BirthContracts; there is no spontaneous creation.
- Micro individuals are realized only through refinement contracts.
- Pop-out is forbidden; collapse is explicit and preserves identity.
- Refusal or deferral is the correct outcome when refinement is not allowed.

## What replaces pop-in/out
- Macro populations persist as cohorts or statistics.
- Refinement realizes micro individuals when needed and allowed.
- Collapse aggregates micro state back into macro deterministically.

## Anti-fabrication invariants
- No life appears without birth.
- No life disappears without death.
- No micro individual fabricated from macro without a contract.
