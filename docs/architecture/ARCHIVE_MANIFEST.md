# Archive and Quarantine Manifest (CLEAN1)

Status: binding.
Scope: inventory of archived and quarantined paths with rationale.

## Archived

| Path | Rationale | Replacement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `legacy/` | Historical artifacts kept for reference only. | Canonical contracts in `docs/architecture/`. |
| `docs/archive/` | Superseded or historical documentation. | Canonical contracts in `docs/architecture/`. |

## Quarantined (build-excluded)

| Path | Rationale | Revival condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `labs/` | Experimental prototypes not part of mainline. | Must be reviewed against contracts and moved into canonical home. |
| `tmp/` | Local scratch space only. | Move stable content into canonical home with prompt ownership. |
| `build/` | Local build output. | Regenerated by local builds only. |
| `out/` | Local output artifacts. | Regenerated by local builds only. |

## Notes

Archived and quarantined paths are guarded by tests under `tests/contract/`.
