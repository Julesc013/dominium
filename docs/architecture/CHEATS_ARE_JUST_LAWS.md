# Cheats Are Just Laws (OMNI1)

Status: binding.
Scope: anti-cheat as law-gated authority and explicit denials.

## Purpose
Define anti-cheat as law and capability policy, not as hidden detection or
special-case exceptions.

## Principles
- Cheats and dev tools are the same intents.
- Most actors are denied by law, not by hidden code.
- Violations result in refusal and audit records.

## Law Expression
Anti-cheat is expressed as:
- meta-law and policy law that deny tool capabilities,
- integrity law that restricts modified clients and external tools,
- deterministic refusals with explainable law paths.

Optional disconnect or penalties are handled elsewhere, but must be triggered
from law decisions and recorded in audit logs.
