# Movement as Logistics (TRAVEL1)





Status: draft.


Scope: movement as a logistics problem, not a free action.





## Principle


Movement consumes time, capacity, and cost. Every travel edge is a logistics


contract, not a shortcut.





## Logistics Integration


- Capacity limits govern congestion and queueing.


- Costs are explicit and ledger-backed.


- Scheduling is done on ACT and audited.





## Governance


- Law and capability gates apply at each edge.


- Denials are deterministic and explainable.


- AI uses the same rules as players.





## Why This Matters


- Prevents implicit teleportation.


- Avoids DoS from mass movement.


- Keeps AI-only worlds bounded and believable.
