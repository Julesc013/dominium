# Scale and Complexity (FUTURE0)





Status: binding.


Scope: why the system scales without simulating everything all the time.





Dominium scales by refusing global work. Macro state is authoritative; micro


detail is realized only when needed and lawfully refinable.





## Invariants


- Simulation advances by scheduled effects on ACT.


- Refinement is contract-driven and deterministic.


- Absence is valid and must not break simulation.





## Why nothing simulates everything


- Simulation advances by scheduled effects, not global loops.


- Domains bound computation and jurisdiction.


- Refinement is contract-driven and interest-based.


- Absence is valid; systems must function with zero agents or zero economy.





## Macro to micro


Macro models track totals and rates. Refinement realizes micro detail only when


observed, interacted with, or required by law. Collapse aggregates micro state


back into macro deterministically.





## Forbidden assumptions


- Any system that requires scanning all entities each ACT step is invalid.


- Implicit background simulation is not allowed.


- Macro results cannot be invented to satisfy micro UI.





## Scale scenarios (explicit)


- Millions of players: interest and domain partitioning bound per-shard work.


- Trillions of agents (macro): macro cohorts exist without per-agent updates.


- Galaxy or universe scale: domains and travel edges bound reachability.


- AI-only autorun worlds: perception acceleration advances macro state only.


- Single-room puzzle worlds: refinement can remain micro at all times.
