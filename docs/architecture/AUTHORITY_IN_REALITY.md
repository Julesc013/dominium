# Authority in Reality (REALITY0)





Status: binding.


Scope: how power interacts with existence, space, time, and visitability.





There are no game modes. There are only laws and capabilities. Spectator to


god-mode behavior is data configuration, not special code paths.





## Authority layers (OMNI0)


Canonical authority layers:


- SIMULATION


- TEMPORAL


- SPATIAL


- EPISTEMIC


- GOVERNANCE


- EXECUTION


- INTEGRITY


- ARCHIVAL





Layers are schema-defined; capabilities are additive and scoped.





## Authority rules


- All power flows through law-gated effects.


- Capabilities allow attempts; law decides outcomes.


- Omnipotence is additive capability, not bypass.


- Archived history is immutable; changes require explicit forks.





## Invariants


- No authority bypass without law and audit.


- Capabilities are additive and scoped.


- Archived history is immutable unless forked.





## Reality interactions (examples)


Spectator volume:


- EPISTEMIC allow, SIMULATION deny.


- Read-only, law-gated access; no mutation.





Competitive lockdown:


- Deny modified clients and tool intents.


- Law enforces strict capability scopes and audit.





Anarchy frontier:


- Broad capability grants within a domain.


- Still no existence or archival bypass.





Admin chamber:


- Scoped omnipotent capability inside a domain.


- Requires explicit effects and audit for any mutation.





## Forbidden assumptions


- "Game modes" can replace law and capability.


- Admins may bypass audit or archival rules.
