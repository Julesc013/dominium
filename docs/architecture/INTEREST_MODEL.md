# Interest Model (SCALE0)

Status: binding.
Scope: activation rules for fidelity promotion/demotion.

## Purpose
Interest is a first-class signal that controls when and where simulation
fidelity is activated. It is explicit, deterministic, and auditable.

## Interest sources
Interest MAY be generated by:
- player possession
- agent planning targets
- active processes
- sensors/observation
- institutions (audits, regulation, enforcement)
- logistics flows

## Activation rules
- Domains with non-zero interest MAY be promoted to higher fidelity.
- Domains with zero interest MAY be collapsed.
- Promotion/demotion MUST occur only at commit boundaries.
- Promotion MUST respect budget policies.
- Demotion MUST produce a macro capsule.

## Determinism and visibility
- Interest is explicit data (interest sets), not camera/view state.
- Interest does not grant authority or bypass law.
- Interest changes are logged events and replayable.

## Refusals and deferrals
- Budget gate may refuse promotion (REFUSE_BUDGET_EXCEEDED).
- Budget gate may defer collapse/expansion (DEFER_COLLAPSE / DEFER_EXPANSION).
- All refusals/deferrals are explicit, logged, and replayable.
