# Space, Time, and Existence (REALITY0)





Status: binding.


Scope: how space, time, and existence interlock in the Reality Layer.





## Existence and archival states (EXIST0/EXIST2)


Existence states:


- NONEXISTENT


- DECLARED


- LATENT


- REFINABLE


- REALIZED


- ARCHIVED





Archival states:


- LIVE


- FROZEN


- ARCHIVED


- FORKED





Existence is not fidelity. A subject may be LATENT or REFINABLE and still be


alive at macro scale with conservation and provenance intact.





## Allowed transitions (textual diagram)


Existence lifecycle:


- NONEXISTENT -> DECLARED -> LATENT -> REFINABLE -> REALIZED


- REALIZED -> LATENT (collapse)


- ANY -> ARCHIVED


- ARCHIVED -> REFINABLE only via FORK (new identity)





Archival lifecycle:


- LIVE -> FROZEN -> ARCHIVED


- ARCHIVED -> FORKED (new timeline; parent remains immutable)





All transitions are explicit effects, law-gated, and audited.





## Space (domains) and time (ACT)


- Domains define where reality exists and which jurisdictions apply.


- ACT is authoritative and immutable; observer clocks only derive perception.


- A subject can exist without being realized; time can advance without


  micro-level simulation.





## Domain scale and geometry


- Thin domains (corridors, membranes) are valid SDF volumes with narrow extent.


- Irregular domains (caves, asteroid fields) are valid SDF volumes with complex


  boundaries; determinism is preserved by fixed-point evaluation.


- Massive domains (continents, planets, galaxies) are valid SDF volumes with


  nested sub-domains; scale does not change the model.





## Alive but not simulated (formal)


Alive means:


- macro state is conserved and provable,


- existence state is LATENT or REFINABLE,


- refinement contracts exist and can realize micro state deterministically,


- observed history is preserved.





It does not require continuous micro simulation.





## Invariants


- Existence states are explicit and not inferred.


- ACT is immutable; perception is derived only.


- Refinement requires contracts and preserves observed history.





## Forbidden assumptions


- Existence implies realization or micro simulation.


- Time perception can alter authoritative scheduling.
