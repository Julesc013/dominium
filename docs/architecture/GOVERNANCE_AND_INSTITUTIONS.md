# Governance and Institutions (CIV0+)





Status: binding.


Scope: canonical model for institutions, governance, and legitimacy.





Institutions enforce rules using resources and legitimacy. Governance is law


layered on institutions, scoped to domains, and never a hard-coded game mode.





## Invariants


- Governance is law layered on institutions, not a mode.


- Authority is capability-based and law-gated.


- Legitimacy bounds enforcement capacity.





## Institutions


Institutions are organized rule-enforcing entities:


- governments, corporations, guilds, religions, militaries


- backed by resources and legitimacy


- bounded to domains and authority scopes





Institutions cannot bypass law or capability gates. They act through explicit,


audited effects.





## Governance


Governance is a configuration of:


- institutions (enforcement bodies)


- law profiles (targets and policies)


- legitimacy signals


- resources and budgets


- domain scope





No abstract "civ bonuses" exist. All governance effects are law-gated.





## Legitimacy


Legitimacy represents acceptance, compliance, and stability:


- decays when needs are unmet


- grows with successful outcomes


- bounds enforcement capacity





## Macro and micro consistency


Governance outcomes at macro scale must reconcile with refined micro details.


If enforcement is weak at macro scale, micro outcomes must reflect that.
