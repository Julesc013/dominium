# Project Execution Baseline (MEGA HANDOFF)

This document is the canonical representation of PROMPT MEGA HANDOFF — PROJECT CANON & EXECUTION BASELINE.

Normative rules:
- Canon is locked; architecture is closed.
- All work must follow PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → TEST → COMMIT → PUSH.
- RepoX/TestX are the enforcement authority; no bypasses.
- Changes outside permitted scope are invalid and must be reverted.
