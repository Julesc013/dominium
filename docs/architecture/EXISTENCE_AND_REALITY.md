# Existence and Reality (EXIST0)





Status: draft.


Scope: canonical meaning of existence across the project.





## Purpose


Existence is explicit, universal, and orthogonal to fidelity and authority.


Nothing half-exists, nothing pops in, and nothing disappears without an effect.





## Orthogonality


Existence is separate from:


- Fidelity: macro vs micro representation.


- Authority: authoritative vs derived computation.





Macro-only civilizations can exist indefinitely. Micro-level detail is optional


and contract-driven.





## Canonical States (Summary)


- NONEXISTENT: not referable.


- DECLARED: conceptual existence only.


- LATENT: macro-only, persistent.


- REFINABLE: guaranteed to refine deterministically.


- REALIZED: micro-instantiated, budgeted.


- ARCHIVED: frozen, read-only, forkable.





See `schema/existence/SPEC_EXISTENCE_STATES.md` for definitions.





## Reality and Archives


- ARCHIVED objects preserve truth and provenance.


- Forking an archive creates a new identity; the archive remains unchanged.


- AI-only autorun universes can remain LATENT or REFINABLE indefinitely.





## Integration Points


- Domains: existence respects domain volumes and ownership.


- Refinement contracts: refinement is explicit and deterministic (EXIST1).


- Law kernel: every transition is law-gated (existence law + domain target).


- Work IR: transitions are explicit effects, not implicit inference.


- Sharding: ownership and placement respect existence state.


- Tools: inspection is allowed; mutation is gated and auditable.





## Invariants


- Existence is never inferred.


- Absence is valid.


- Refinement never fabricates history.


- Collapses preserve invariants and provenance.
