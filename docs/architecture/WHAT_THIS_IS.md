# What This Project Is (CANON0)

Status: binding.
Scope: canonical statement of identity and intent.

Dominium/Domino is a deterministic world runtime and law-governed simulation OS.
It is built to host multi-scale universes with explicit existence, travel,
authority, and time perception.

## Core identity
- A deterministic simulation runtime with reproducible outcomes.
- A truth/perception split where views are derived and authoritative state is
  explicit.
- A law-governed simulation OS where authority is data-defined.
- A multi-scale reality model with explicit existence/refinement and visitability.
- A product stack (engine + game + client/server + launcher/setup + tools) that
  separates runtime, control plane, and tooling.
- Content-agnostic executables: all meaning comes from packs resolved by UPS.
- Zero-asset boot paths for all products.

## It can host
- player-only worlds
- AI-only autorun universes
- mixed civilizations
- spectator museums and replays
- anarchy servers
- god-mode admin tools (law-gated and audited)

## Invariants
- Engine/game separation is preserved.
- Determinism and provenance are enforced.
- Absence and refusal are valid outcomes, not errors.
- There are no game modes; behavior is law + capability + policy.

## Forbidden assumptions
- It is not acceptable to bypass law or audit for convenience.
- It is not acceptable to fabricate existence or resources.

## Dependencies
