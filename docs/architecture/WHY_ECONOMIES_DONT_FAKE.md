# Why Economies Don't Fake (CIV0+)





Status: binding.


Scope: explain why goods, output, and capacity cannot be fabricated.





The economy model is conservation-first. Goods, services, and currency exist


only if produced or exchanged explicitly. There are no balance spawns.





## Why fabrication is forbidden


- Production requires inputs, time, and capacity.


- Markets exchange declared supply only.


- Logistics requires Travel edges and schedules.


- Macro totals must match micro reality when refined.





## What replaces fake output


- Macro aggregates track production and inventory truthfully.


- Refinement realizes micro details from macro totals deterministically.


- Refusal or deferral is the correct outcome when capacity is absent.





## Anti-fabrication invariants


- No goods without production inputs.


- No production without explicit contracts.


- No logistics bypasses the Travel graph.


- No governance without institutions and legitimacy.
