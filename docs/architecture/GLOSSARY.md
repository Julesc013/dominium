# Glossary (ARCH0 Binding)





Status: binding.


Scope: canonical terms for architecture and enforcement. See


`docs/architectureitecture/TERMINOLOGY.md` for full terminology and aliases.





Engine: Mechanisms only; deterministic substrate and runtime systems.


Game: Meaning and authoritative rules built on engine public API.


Content: Data-only definitions delivered via packs; no executable logic.


Pack: Versioned content bundle resolved by UPS; declares capabilities.


Module: A composable system with declared invariants and dependencies.


System: A running instance of a module.


Law: A rule governing existence or action; evaluated by the law kernel.


Policy: A constraint on permitted action (rates, scopes, windows).


Capability: An additive permission required to attempt actions.


Authority token: Explicit credential that confers capabilities.


Authority: Effective power derived from capabilities plus law outcomes.


Intent: A request to do something; admitted by law before execution.


Action: A requested operation that passes law and enters a process.


Process: Deterministic rule pipeline that produces authoritative outcomes.


Event: A scheduled state transition on ACT.


Effect: The result of an event; authoritative or derived.


Refusal: A law output that denies an action with explanation and audit.


ACT: Authoritative simulation time; monotonic and never warped.


Existence state: Explicit state of a subject (NONEXISTENT..ARCHIVED).


Refinement: Deterministic realization of micro state from macro state.


Domain: A spatial volume that bounds where reality exists and laws apply.


Visitability: Reachability plus refinable existence and a valid contract.


Topology node: Canonical identity in the world graph.


Entity: Runtime/view instance; authoritative entities are topology nodes.


Structure: Built environment or infrastructure within topology.


Representation tier: Explicit, hybrid, or procedural detail level.


Field: Authoritative spatial dataset; maps/layers are derived views.


Snapshot (objective): Authoritative state used for saves and replays.


Snapshot (subjective): Derived, observer-specific view.


Work IR: Declarative representation of authoritative tasks.


Access IR: Declarative representation of read/write/reduction access.


Derived: Non-authoritative computation that must not affect truth.
