# Objective vs Subjective Reality

Status: canonical.
Scope: truth model and epistemic boundaries.
Authority: canonical. All perception and knowledge systems MUST defer to this.

## Objective truth
- Objective truth is the single authoritative simulation state.
- There MUST be exactly one objective truth for a given universe state.
- Objective truth MUST be independent of observers, clients, and tools.

## Subjective truth
- Subjective truth is a projection of objective truth filtered by knowledge,
  sensors, authority, and capability scope.
- Subjective truth MUST NOT fork or replace objective truth.
- Subjective truth MUST be derivable from objective truth and declared
  epistemic artifacts.

## Epistemic uncertainty
- Uncertainty MUST be represented explicitly as knowledge or measurement
  artifacts, not as silent omission.
- Unknown, latent, inferred, and known states MUST be distinguished and
  preserved.
- Epistemic artifacts MUST carry provenance and confidence descriptors.

## Ignorance, misinformation, secrecy, and error
- Ignorance is represented as missing or latent knowledge artifacts, not as
  missing objective truth.
- Misinformation and error are represented as subjective artifacts with
  provenance and validity bounds.
- Secrecy is represented by access control on knowledge artifacts, not by
  altering objective truth.
