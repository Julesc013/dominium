# Civilizations and History Baseline (T22)

Status: baseline.
Scope: derived history, collective memory, and civilization graphs.

## What exists
- History sources that tie replay/process events to perspectives.
- Derived historical events with confidence, uncertainty, and bias.
- Epochs as fuzzy, contestable intervals.
- Civilization graphs built from institutional nodes and relational edges.
- Deterministic history processes (record, forget, revise, mythologize).

## What does NOT exist (yet)
- Lore or scripted events.
- Omniscient narration or complete timelines.
- Retroactive changes to physical outcomes.
- New physics or social primitives beyond existing layers.

## How history is derived
- Sources reference replay/process events with explicit provenance.
- Historical events summarize sources; uncertainty and bias are retained.
- Processes alter memory explicitly (no implicit rewrites).

## Civilization graphs
- Nodes are institutions; edges are relationships (cooperation, dependency, conflict, cultural exchange).
- Weights use trust, trade volume, and shared standards signals.
- Graphs are descriptive and may overlap or fragment.

## Inspection and UX
- Timelines show multiple perspectives for the same event.
- Provenance, bias, and uncertainty are visible.
- Myths vs. evidence can be compared side-by-side.

## Determinism and scaling
- All derivation is deterministic and replayable.
- No global scans per query; interest and budget bounds apply.
- Collapsed domains retain coarse historical summaries.

## Why this matters
History becomes a living constraint on trust, law, conflict, and knowledge,
enabling emergent narrative without scripted lore.
