# Status Now

## REAL

- Deterministic simulation and replay invariants are enforced by RepoX and TestX.
- Process-only mutation guard is active and tested.
- Canonical tool discovery is PATH-based and self-canonicalized by RepoX/TestX/gate runner.
- Setup/Launcher/Client/Server CLI surfaces build and validate through TestX.

## SOON

- SOON features are treated as experimental scaffolding.
- SOON features must be removable without save/world migration.

## STUB

- Dist lane release packaging policies exist but remain non-release (0.0.0/BII-only).
- Optional remediation strategies can be declared in playbooks without immediate implementation.

## DEFERRED

- Any feature requiring simulation semantic change.
- Any ontology expansion beyond Assemblies/Fields/Processes/Agents/Law.
- Any release-channel versioning or GBN allocation.
