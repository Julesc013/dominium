# Dominium Philosophy

Dominium is a simulation platform for living worlds. It is not a conventional “game engine” and it is not a single game. It is a long‑lived, deterministic system that lets different worlds emerge from data, rules, and processes without hardcoded outcomes.

## Why determinism matters

Determinism means the same inputs produce the same results. That makes worlds fair, replays trustworthy, bugs reproducible, and multiplayer stable across machines. It is also the only honest way to scale a simulation without hidden divergence.

## Why data defines reality

In Dominium, data is the source of truth. Schemas define the shape of reality. Content packs define what exists. Code interprets data but does not decide what the world “should” be. This keeps worlds mod‑safe, future‑proof, and auditable.

## Why refusal is better than silent failure

When a requirement is missing, Dominium refuses with explicit, stable codes. This is safer than guessing, silently degrading, or inventing behavior. Refusals are not errors to hide. They are a contract that keeps worlds honest.

## Why depth is incremental, not hardcoded

Depth grows as new data packs, processes, and standards are added. The platform does not “unlock” features by era or milestone. That keeps the system flexible, avoids brittle assumptions, and lets different worlds progress in different ways.

## Why this is not overengineering

The goal is not complexity for its own sake. The goal is a platform that stays coherent for decades. Determinism, explicit contracts, and data‑first design are how we make that possible.

Dominium is for people who want worlds that can be shared, inspected, debated, extended, and trusted.
