World inspection MUST read field layers and topology through observation stores only.


Queries MUST support LOD and scope filters and MUST surface unknown/latent values explicitly.


Inspection MUST NOT assume geometry is authoritative; geometry is derived.


Inspection MUST be deterministic and read-only.
