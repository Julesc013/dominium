# Tools Settings

Tool settings are local output/inspection preferences and are read-only by default.

## NOW (implemented)

- `output_format`
- `verbosity`
- `filter_options`
- `display_options`

## Rule

Tool commands that mutate state must require explicit mutation commands; settings surfaces
must remain observational by default.
