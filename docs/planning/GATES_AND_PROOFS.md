# Gates And Proofs

## 1. Purpose

This document hardens the entry gates and exit proofs for the next execution block.
It is the operational bridge between the P-4 execution program and one-by-one future mega prompt generation.

It covers:

- `0-0`
- `Λ-0` through `Λ-6`
- `CHK-ΛΣΦ-0`
- `Σ-A`
- `Σ-B`
- `CHK-ΣΦ-0`
- already known human review gates from P-2 and P-4

## 2. Immediate Control Facts

- current next executable prompt: `Λ-0`
- current next review checkpoint: `RG-SEM-0`
- immediate downstream target after `Λ-6`: `CHK-ΛΣΦ-0`
- `Φ grounding` must not begin before `CHK-ΣΦ-0`
- deep `Φ` and all `Ζ` work remain blocked or dangerous even after this document exists

## 3. Gate Entries

### `0-0` Planning Hardening

- Entry gate:
  `Ω`, `Ξ`, `Π`, and `P-0` through `P-4` are complete and the next executable prompt is still `Λ-0`.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  continuity can remain in chat memory alone; future prompts can infer gates ad hoc; transcript summaries outrank repo artifacts.
- Required outputs:
  merged program state, extend-not-replace ledger, gates-and-proofs layer, chat handoff policy, and matching JSON registries.
- Exit proof:
  all required hardening artifacts exist; `Λ-0` is still the next executable prompt; `RG-SEM-0` is still the next review checkpoint; markdown and JSON align.
- Downstream enables:
  `Λ-0` through `Λ-5`
- Remaining blockers:
  `RG-SEM-0`, `Λ-6`, `CHK-ΛΣΦ-0`, `Σ-A`, `Σ-B`, `CHK-ΣΦ-0`

### `Λ-0` `UNIVERSAL_REALITY_FRAMEWORK-0`

- Entry gate:
  `0-0` exit proof is satisfied and no new same-tier conflict has appeared in semantic roots.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  Λ needs a clean-room ontology; semantic embodiment is absent from the repo; field or pack ownership can be silently chosen here.
- Required outputs:
  universal reality framework document and explicit mapping from live semantic roots into that framework.
- Exit proof:
  framework terminology is grounded in live roots and canon/glossary; no quarantine winner was chosen silently; next prompt remains `Λ-1`.
- Downstream enables:
  `Λ-1`, `Λ-2`, `Λ-3`
- Remaining blockers:
  `RG-SEM-0` still required later; ownership splits still unresolved

### `Λ-1` `DOMAIN_CONTRACT_TEMPLATE-0`

- Entry gate:
  `Λ-0` exit proof is satisfied.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  domain contract work can ignore `schema/**`; `data/packs` already replaces `packs`; `schemas/**` is automatically canonical law.
- Required outputs:
  domain contract template and boundary notes for pack and schema law.
- Exit proof:
  template is explicitly grounded in `schema/**`, pack law, and experience surfaces; pack-driven integration doctrine remains intact.
- Downstream enables:
  `Λ-2`, `Λ-3`, `Φ-1`, `Φ-3`
- Remaining blockers:
  pack ownership split and schema projection split remain active review zones

### `Λ-2` `CAPABILITY_SURFACES-0`

- Entry gate:
  `Λ-0` and `Λ-1` exit proofs are satisfied.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  capability surfaces are absent; optional content can be hardwired; capability meaning can be inferred from one local surface alone.
- Required outputs:
  capability surface specification and capability-to-domain map.
- Exit proof:
  capability vocabulary is mapped onto live pack, control, and compat surfaces and does not bypass law-gated authority.
- Downstream enables:
  `Λ-4`, `Σ-B`, `Υ-9`
- Remaining blockers:
  cross-domain bridge review remains pending

### `Λ-3` `REPRESENTATION_LADDERS_AND_SEMANTIC_ASCENT-0`

- Entry gate:
  `Λ-0` and `Λ-1` exit proofs are satisfied.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  renderer can mutate truth; perception and truth may collapse; representation ladders can be authored without live observer/presentation evidence.
- Required outputs:
  representation ladder specification and projection boundary notes.
- Exit proof:
  truth / perceived / render separation is preserved explicitly and the ladder is grounded in live observer/presentation surfaces.
- Downstream enables:
  `Λ-4`, `Φ-3`
- Remaining blockers:
  cross-domain bridge review remains pending

### `Λ-4` `FORMALIZATION_CHAIN-0`

- Entry gate:
  `Λ-0`, `Λ-2`, and `Λ-3` exit proofs are satisfied.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  formalization chain may remain abstract; proof and semantic signals do not matter; substitution can happen without explicit criteria.
- Required outputs:
  recognition / formalization / substitution chain and escalation criteria.
- Exit proof:
  chain is tied to live proof and semantic surfaces and defines explicit refusal/escalation rather than best-effort guesswork.
- Downstream enables:
  `Λ-6`
- Remaining blockers:
  `RG-SEM-0` still required before `Λ-6`

### `Λ-5` `PLAYER_DESIRE_ACCEPTANCE_MAP-0`

- Entry gate:
  `Λ-0`, `Λ-1`, and `Λ-2` exit proofs are satisfied.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  player desire can be modeled outside law/profile boundaries; acceptance map can ignore refusal semantics; experience surfaces are optional evidence.
- Required outputs:
  player desire acceptance map and refusal taxonomy.
- Exit proof:
  acceptance and refusal boundaries are tied to live experience/profile and law surfaces.
- Downstream enables:
  `Σ-B`, `Λ-6`
- Remaining blockers:
  `RG-SEM-0` still required before `Λ-6`

### `RG-SEM-0` Semantic Ownership Review

- Entry gate:
  `Λ-0` through `Λ-5` exit proofs are satisfied.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  review may silently choose winners; unresolved ownership is acceptable if hidden; `schema` and `schemas` are the same unless proven otherwise.
- Required outputs:
  explicit reviewed status for `field` / `fields`, `schema` / `schemas`, and `packs` / `data/packs`, plus any residual quarantine notes.
- Exit proof:
  every active split item is either explicitly retained as quarantine, explicitly mapped for future use, or explicitly escalated; no silent canonicalization remains.
- Downstream enables:
  `Λ-6`, `CHK-ΛΣΦ-0`
- Remaining blockers:
  runtime and release checkpoints still remain for later series

### `Λ-6` `CROSS_DOMAIN_BRIDGES-0`

- Entry gate:
  `RG-SEM-0` and `Λ-0` through `Λ-5` exit proofs are satisfied.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  bridge work may settle ownership on its own; bridge semantics can bypass pack/schema conflicts; bridge closure means semantic work is globally complete.
- Required outputs:
  cross-domain bridge map and explicit unresolved ownership list if any remain.
- Exit proof:
  bridges are defined with explicit ownership assumptions, residual disputes remain visible, and no hidden migration/coercion was introduced.
- Downstream enables:
  `CHK-ΛΣΦ-0`
- Remaining blockers:
  `Σ-A`, `Σ-B`, and `CHK-ΣΦ-0` still remain before `Φ grounding`

### `CHK-ΛΣΦ-0` Λ / Σ / Φ Boundary Checkpoint

- Entry gate:
  `Λ-6` exit proof is satisfied.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  semantic completion implies runtime readiness; Σ may skip preservation of the existing governance baseline; Φ may begin before Σ contracts are frozen.
- Required outputs:
  checkpoint note confirming stable semantic vocabulary, unchanged quarantine map, and the exact `Σ-A` start set.
- Exit proof:
  `Σ-A` is explicitly authorized; the next executable prompt family is unambiguous; `Φ` remains gated behind `CHK-ΣΦ-0`.
- Downstream enables:
  `Σ-A`
- Remaining blockers:
  `Σ-B`, `CHK-ΣΦ-0`, `Φ grounding`

### `Σ-A` Governance Normalization Phase

- Entry gate:
  `CHK-ΛΣΦ-0` exit proof is satisfied.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  a new governance baseline is needed; mirrored docs can outrank `AGENTS.md`; vendor-neutral mirrors may be skipped.
- Required outputs:
  `Σ-0`, `Σ-1`, and `Σ-2` outputs as a phase set:
  governance delta, mirror surface spec, and safety/escalation policy delta.
- Exit proof:
  existing governance is preserved rather than replaced; safety and refusal rules are explicit; vendor-neutral mirror structure exists.
- Downstream enables:
  `Σ-B`
- Remaining blockers:
  task catalog, natural-language bridge, MCP interface, `CHK-ΣΦ-0`

### `Σ-B` Task And Interface Freeze Phase

- Entry gate:
  `Σ-A` exit proof is satisfied.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  task classes can outrun Λ capability surfaces; wrapper contracts can hard-pin disputed semantics; vendor-specific convenience beats governance clarity.
- Required outputs:
  `Σ-3`, `Σ-4`, and `Σ-5` outputs as a phase set:
  XStack task catalog, natural-language task bridge, and MCP/interface wrapper specification.
- Exit proof:
  governed task classes exist; wrapper boundaries and refusal paths are explicit; no disputed semantic ownership was silently frozen.
- Downstream enables:
  `CHK-ΣΦ-0`
- Remaining blockers:
  `Φ grounding` still requires explicit checkpoint entry

### `CHK-ΣΦ-0` Σ / Φ Boundary Checkpoint

- Entry gate:
  `Σ-B` exit proof is satisfied.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  Σ completion resolves runtime ownership by itself; deep `Φ` is now automatically ready; `runtime/` may become canonical by convenience.
- Required outputs:
  checkpoint note confirming the first safe `Φ` set, preserved runtime substrate targets, and unchanged quarantine conditions relevant to `Φ`.
- Exit proof:
  `Φ-0` through `Φ-6` are explicitly authorized and deep `Φ` remains blocked pending later gates.
- Downstream enables:
  `Φ grounding`
- Remaining blockers:
  `RG-PHI-0`, `Υ`, `deep Φ`, and `Ζ`

### `RG-PHI-0` Φ Boundary Freeze Review

- Entry gate:
  `Φ-0` through `Φ-6` exit proofs are satisfied.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  deep `Φ` is ready because grounding exists; runtime substrate extraction automatically resolves all ownership; hotswap or distributed authority are now safe by default.
- Required outputs:
  explicit approved runtime boundary map and a ruled list for `Φ-7` through `Φ-14`.
- Exit proof:
  deep `Φ` prompts that remain blocked, dangerous, or review-sensitive are still explicitly marked; nothing is promoted silently.
- Downstream enables:
  `Φ-7`, `Φ-8`
- Remaining blockers:
  `Υ`, `Φ-12`, `Φ-13`, `Φ-14`, `Ζ`

### `RG-PUB-0` Publication And Licensing Review

- Entry gate:
  `Υ-8` and `Υ-9` exit proofs are satisfied.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  publication policy can be inferred from tooling alone; licensing/capability policy can become binding without review; generated echoes can define policy.
- Required outputs:
  explicit publication and licensing review outcomes and any retained restrictions.
- Exit proof:
  publication-sensitive and trust-sensitive later work has explicit approved policy scope.
- Downstream enables:
  `Ζ-6`
- Remaining blockers:
  `RG-ZETA-0`, distributed live-ops gates

### `RG-ZETA-0` Explicit Late Ζ Review

- Entry gate:
  `Φ-14`, `Υ-11`, and `Υ-12` exit proofs are satisfied.
- Forbidden assumptions:
  rollback primitives equal live-ops readiness; distributed authority is proven because tests or precursors exist; extreme Ζ work can begin without executive review.
- Required outputs:
  explicit go / no-go decision for distributed or extreme Ζ planning.
- Exit proof:
  late Ζ work is either explicitly authorized in bounded form or explicitly deferred as unsafe.
- Downstream enables:
  `Ζ-7`, `Ζ-8`
- Remaining blockers:
  any remaining deep `Φ` or release/trust proof gaps still called out by review
