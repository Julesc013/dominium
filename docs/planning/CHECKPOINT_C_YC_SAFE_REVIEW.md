# C-ΥC_SAFE_REVIEW

## A. Purpose And Scope

This checkpoint exists because the repo has now completed:

- `Φ-B3 — MULTI_VERSION_COEXISTENCE-0`
- `Υ-B0 — MANUAL_AUTOMATION_PARITY_AND_REHEARSAL-0`
- `Υ-B1 — OPERATOR_TRANSACTION_RECEIPTS_AND_PROVENANCE_CONTINUITY-0`
- `Υ-B2 — RELEASE_OPS_EXECUTION_ENVELOPE-0`
- `Υ-C0 — RELEASE_REHEARSAL_SANDBOX_AND_PROOF_BACKED_ROLLBACK_ALIGNMENT-0`
- `Υ-C1 — CANARY_AND_DETERMINISTIC_DOWNGRADE_EXECUTION-0`
- `Υ-C2 — TRUST_EXECUTION_AND_REVOCATION_CONTINUITY-0`

It evaluates whether that completed band now provides enough law to reopen risky runtime work honestly, or whether Dominium still needs another operational maturity band first.

This checkpoint governs:

- readiness reassessment for `Φ-B4` and `Φ-B5`
- reassessment of any further `Υ` families that remain useful or blocked
- explicit `Ζ` blocker reduction after the completed `Υ-C` band
- the exact next execution order from the current repo state
- the checkpoint packaging handoff for later upload and continuation

This checkpoint does not:

- execute `Φ-B4`
- execute `Φ-B5`
- execute further `Υ` work
- implement release, trust, or live-ops machinery
- plan `Ζ` in full detail

Relation to earlier checkpoints:

- `C-ΥA_SAFE_REVIEW` reopened `Φ-B3` but kept `Φ-B4` dangerous and `Φ-B5` premature
- `C-ΦB3ΥB_SAFE_REVIEW` required a narrow `Υ-C` band before any honest move toward `Φ-B4`
- this checkpoint is the first review after that `Υ-C` band completed

## B. Current Checkpoint State

The active checkpoint state is:

- `post-Φ-B3 / post-Υ-B-and-Υ-C / pre-Φ-B4-or-other-next-block`

Candidate next work under review:

- `Φ-B4 — HOTSWAP_BOUNDARIES-0`
- `Φ-B5 — DISTRIBUTED_AUTHORITY_FOUNDATIONS-0`
- selected further `Υ` families concerned with live trust rotation, revocation propagation, live-cutover receipt generalization, and publication or trust operationalization

This checkpoint explicitly eliminates the current ambiguity set:

- more release doctrine does not automatically make risky runtime ready
- more runtime doctrine does not automatically outrank operational maturity gaps
- completed `Υ-C` does not place `Φ-B4` and `Φ-B5` on equal footing
- `Ζ` remains blocker-shadowed even though the control-plane doctrine stack is now materially stronger

## C. Sufficiency Review

### C.1 Hotswap Boundary Reconsideration

Completed `Φ-B3 + Υ-B0..Υ-B2 + Υ-C0..Υ-C2` are now sufficient to reconsider `Φ-B4` as a doctrine prompt.

Why:

- coexistence law is explicit and now blocks hotswap-by-stealth rather than leaving coexistence vague
- parity, rehearsal, receipt, provenance, execution-envelope, rollback-alignment, canary, downgrade, and trust-continuity layers are now explicit
- runtime law already supplies lifecycle, replay, snapshot, and isolation floors that `Φ-B4` must consume
- the remaining unresolved runtime question is now exactly the lawful cutover and replacement boundary grammar that `Φ-B4` is supposed to define

This does not mean hotswap is safe to execute today.
It means the repo now has enough upstream law to define the boundary honestly instead of improvising it.

### C.2 Distributed Authority Reconsideration

Completed work is still not sufficient to reopen `Φ-B5` beyond a premature state.

Why:

- `docs/runtime/MULTI_VERSION_COEXISTENCE.md` explicitly forbids distributed split-authority coexistence by convenience
- `docs/blueprint/FOUNDATION_READINESS_MATRIX.md` still classifies `Distributed shard relocation` as `unrealistic_currently`
- live trust-root rotation remains foundation-ready but not implemented, with trust-root state still empty in `data/registries/trust_root_registry.json`
- trust policy remains provisional in `data/registries/trust_policy_registry.json`
- the repo still lacks explicit deterministic replication, authority handoff, quorum proof, and state-partition transfer proof surfaces

### C.3 Further Release And Control-Plane Operational Maturity

Further `Υ` work is still possible, but it is no longer the best prerequisite before `Φ-B4`.

Why:

- the narrow `Υ-B` and `Υ-C` bands already closed the major control-plane ambiguity set that blocked an honest `Φ-B4` discussion
- the next missing foundation is now runtime cutover boundary law rather than another release-only doctrine layer
- several plausible further `Υ` families depend on the answer to `Φ-B4`, especially anything that would claim live-cutover receipt generalization, live trust rotation choreography, or publication/trust operationalization under runtime-affecting conditions

### C.4 Ζ Blocker Reduction

The completed band materially reduces `Ζ` ambiguity, but does not make `Ζ` plan-ready in full.

What improved:

- release-control rehearsal, rollback proof, canary, downgrade, and trust continuity are now explicit law rather than folklore
- the trust and revocation blocker family is narrower and more concrete
- `Φ-B4` can now be reopened as a bounded doctrine question rather than being rejected outright on control-plane immaturity grounds

What remains open:

- runtime cutover legality
- distributed authority foundations
- live trust rotation and revocation propagation
- live-cutover receipt continuity

## D. Risky Φ-B Readiness Review

### D.1 `Φ-B4 — HOTSWAP_BOUNDARIES-0`

Judgment: `ready_with_cautions`

Rationale:

- `docs/runtime/LIFECYCLE_MANAGER.md` already preserves the distinction among stop, quiesce, suspend, retire, and later replace or handoff
- `docs/runtime/SANDBOXING_AND_ISOLATION_MODEL.md` still treats hotswap as dangerous, but now supplies the containment floor `Φ-B4` must consume
- `docs/runtime/MULTI_VERSION_COEXISTENCE.md` already prevents coexistence from being used as restartless replacement by stealth
- `docs/release/RELEASE_REHEARSAL_SANDBOX_AND_PROOF_BACKED_ROLLBACK_ALIGNMENT.md` and `docs/release/CANARY_AND_DETERMINISTIC_DOWNGRADE_EXECUTION.md` now separate rehearsal, rollback, downgrade, and canary semantics from live replacement claims
- the remaining work is exactly to define lawful boundaries, invalidity classes, and non-claims around restartless or partial replacement

Cautions:

- `Φ-B4` must remain doctrine-only
- it must not overclaim that rehearsal, downgrade, or trust maturity proves live cutover safety
- it must preserve replay, snapshot, isolation, lifecycle, coexistence, and trust continuity floors without weakening them

### D.2 `Φ-B5 — DISTRIBUTED_AUTHORITY_FOUNDATIONS-0`

Judgment: `premature`

Rationale:

- distributed authority still lacks explicit authority handoff law, deterministic replication posture, and state-partition transfer proof
- the trust stack is more explicit, but still not operationally mature enough for live distributed authority claims
- `security/trust/trust_verifier.py` and `release/update_resolver.py` prove local trust-bearing control-plane handling exists, but not distributed trust convergence or distributed revocation choreography
- `docs/blueprint/FOUNDATION_READINESS_MATRIX.md` still records `Distributed shard relocation` as `unrealistic_currently`

`Φ-B5` therefore remains downstream of both `Φ-B4` and later checkpointed reassessment.

## E. Further Υ Readiness Review

The checkpoint does not find another required `Υ` band before `Φ-B4`, but it does identify the next likely operational families after `Φ-B4` clarifies runtime cutover boundaries.

### E.1 Live Trust Rotation And Revocation Propagation

Judgment: `blocked`

Why:

- trust roots are still empty in canonical registry state
- trust policies are still provisional
- `docs/blueprint/MANUAL_REVIEW_GATES.md` still keeps trust-root governance changes under `FULL` review with rotation choreography and downgrade plus revocation proof requirements
- live propagation semantics should not be frozen before `Φ-B4` clarifies runtime-affecting cutover boundaries

### E.2 Live-Cutover Receipt And Runtime Continuity Generalization

Judgment: `blocked`

Why:

- receipts and revocation continuity are now explicit
- but their live-cutover generalization still depends on the answer to `Φ-B4`
- freezing that family first would risk letting control-plane continuity doctrine invent runtime cutover meaning by convenience

### E.3 Publication And Trust Operationalization

Judgment: `dangerous_to_operationalize_yet`

Why:

- publication and trust gates are explicit
- trust execution and revocation continuity are explicit
- but live trust execution, rotation, and revocation infrastructure remain unimplemented
- further operationalization before `Φ-B4` would still blur release-control maturity with runtime cutover maturity

### E.4 Narrow Release-Controller Or Automation Follow-On Work

Judgment: `mostly_consolidation`

Why:

- the execution envelope, canary, deterministic downgrade, rehearsal, and receipt layers already define the constitutional floor
- additional work in this family is no longer the main blocker reducer before `Φ-B4`

## F. Ζ Blocker Table

The current remaining `Ζ` blockers and prerequisites are:

| Blocker | Status | Why It Still Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `phi_b4_hotswap_boundaries` | `open_with_cautions` | Runtime cutover, replacement, and partial live exchange still lack explicit lawful boundary grammar. |
| `phi_b5_distributed_authority_foundations` | `open` | Authority handoff, replication posture, quorum semantics, and shard relocation proof remain unresolved. |
| `live_trust_root_rotation_prerequisites` | `open` | Trust policies remain provisional and trust roots remain empty. |
| `live_revocation_propagation_and_continuity` | `open_with_cautions` | Revocation continuity is explicit, but live propagation and runtime-sensitive trust transition choreography remain unproven. |
| `live_cutover_receipt_and_provenance_generalization` | `open_with_cautions` | Receipts exist doctrinally, but live cutover and runtime replacement continuity are not yet frozen. |
| `runtime_cutover_proof_across_lifecycle_replay_snapshot_isolation_and_coexistence` | `open` | The runtime law stack is explicit, but the lawful cutover boundary is not yet frozen. |
| `publication_and_trust_execution_operationalization` | `open_with_cautions` | Gates and trust continuity are explicit, but live publication/trust execution systems remain unimplemented and review-heavy. |
| `distributed_trust_and_authority_convergence` | `open` | Nothing yet proves distributed trust, revocation, and authority continuity under runtime-affecting handoff. |

`Ζ` is therefore less ambiguous than before, but still not fully unblocked.

## G. Extension-Over-Replacement Directives

`Φ-B4` must extend and preserve:

- `docs/runtime/LIFECYCLE_MANAGER.md`
- `docs/runtime/EVENT_LOG_AND_REPLAY_DOCTRINE.md`
- `docs/runtime/SNAPSHOT_SERVICE_DOCTRINE.md`
- `docs/runtime/SANDBOXING_AND_ISOLATION_MODEL.md`
- `docs/runtime/MULTI_VERSION_COEXISTENCE.md`
- `docs/runtime/STATE_EXTERNALIZATION.md`
- `docs/release/RELEASE_REHEARSAL_SANDBOX_AND_PROOF_BACKED_ROLLBACK_ALIGNMENT.md`
- `docs/release/CANARY_AND_DETERMINISTIC_DOWNGRADE_EXECUTION.md`
- `docs/release/TRUST_EXECUTION_AND_REVOCATION_CONTINUITY.md`

`Φ-B5` must continue to remain downstream of:

- the eventual output of `Φ-B4`
- trust execution and revocation continuity doctrine
- later checkpointed review of live trust rotation prerequisites
- any later receipt generalization needed for runtime-affecting authority handoff

Any later `Υ` work must extend rather than replace:

- the current receipt and provenance continuity model
- the current release-ops execution envelope
- the rehearsal sandbox and rollback-alignment model
- the canary and deterministic downgrade model
- the trust execution and revocation continuity model

Must avoid replacing:

- canonical ownership-sensitive roots with projections or convenience roots
- runtime boundary doctrine with control-plane folklore
- canonical gate law with tool wrapper behavior
- checkpoint law with stale numbering or older planning text

## H. Ownership And Anti-Reinvention Cautions

The prior cautions remain fully binding:

- `fields/` remains canonical semantic field substrate while `field/` remains transitional
- `schema/` remains canonical semantic contract law while `schemas/` remains projection-facing
- `packs/` remains canonical for runtime packaging and activation scope while `data/packs/` remains scoped authored-pack authority
- canonical prose and semantic specs outrank projected or generated mirrors
- the thin `runtime/` root is not canonical by name alone
- release, archive, mirror, publication, and trust convenience must not infer canon or permission
- stale numbering or titles in older planning artifacts remain evidence, not authority

## I. Final Verdict

Verdict: `proceed to Φ-B4`

Reason:

- the completed `Υ-B` and `Υ-C` bands closed the specific control-plane maturity gaps that previously kept `Φ-B4` dangerous
- `Φ-B4` is now the correct next doctrine prompt because the remaining unresolved gap is runtime cutover boundary law, not another missing release-only doctrine layer
- `Φ-B5` is still premature and must stay closed until after `Φ-B4` and another checkpointed reassessment

Selected ordering mode:

- `Φ-B4 first`

Exact next order from this checkpoint:

1. `Φ-B4 — HOTSWAP_BOUNDARIES-0`
2. new checkpoint immediately after `Φ-B4` before any move toward `Φ-B5`
3. only then reassess whether the next safest block is a narrow `Υ-D` band or guarded movement toward `Φ-B5`

This checkpoint therefore answers the mandatory questions directly:

- the completed `Φ-B3 + Υ-B + Υ-C` band is sufficient to reconsider `Φ-B4`, but not `Φ-B5`
- `Φ-B4` is now `ready_with_cautions`
- `Φ-B5` remains `premature`
- further `Υ` work is still possible, but is no longer the required next step before `Φ-B4`
- `Ζ` remains blocked by runtime cutover, distributed authority, live trust rotation, and live-cutover continuity gaps
