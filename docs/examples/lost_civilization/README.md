# Lost Civilization and Archaeology (Exemplar)

Purpose: demonstrate ruins, archaeology, and competing histories.

## Demonstrates
- Ruins as assemblies with decay provenance.
- Excavation and cataloging as processes.
- Multiple conflicting historical records.

## Dependencies
- Packs: `org.dominium.lib.on_planet.primitives`, `org.dominium.lib.on_planet.processes`.
- Pack: `org.dominium.epistemics.core`.
- Pack: `org.dominium.worldgen.real.earth_macro` (optional grounding).

## Invariants Proved
- Provenance and uncertainty are explicit.
- Epistemic projection does not fork objective truth.
- Capability resolution governs excavation and survey.

## Safe Removal or Modification
- Remove `org.dominium.examples.lost_civilization` to remove the site and records.
- Keep excavation outputs in optional packs to preserve zero-asset boot.
- Use new knowledge artifacts for revisions; do not delete old ones.
