# Wrong-Science Civilization (Exemplar)

Purpose: demonstrate incorrect epistemic models and institutional enforcement.

## Demonstrates
- False theories as knowledge artifacts.
- Institutions enforcing doctrinal constraints.
- Processes and assemblies built on incorrect assumptions.

## Dependencies
- Pack: `org.dominium.epistemics.core`.
- Packs: `org.dominium.lib.on_planet.primitives`, `org.dominium.lib.on_planet.processes`.
- Pack: `org.dominium.worldgen.real.earth_macro` (optional grounding).

## Invariants Proved
- Objective truth is unchanged by belief or doctrine.
- Conflicting knowledge artifacts can coexist.
- Explicit failure and degradation over silent coercion.

## Safe Removal or Modification
- Remove `org.dominium.examples.false_science` to eliminate doctrinal overlays.
- Keep artifacts in separate packs to avoid corrupting objective data.
- Preserve capability IDs if saves reference these processes.
