# Build Overview

This document summarizes the build topology at a high level. For commands,
presets, and option names, see `docs/guides/BUILDING.md` and `docs/ci/BUILD_MATRIX.md`.

## Build graph (high level)
- Core libraries and product frontends are built from the components listed in
  `docs/architecture/COMPONENTS.md`.
- Tests are optional and live under `engine/tests`, `game/tests/phase6`, and
  `tools/validation/fixtures`.

## Component toggles
The root CMake provides toggles to include or exclude tests, tools, setup,
launcher, and game builds. Option names are listed in `docs/guides/BUILDING.md`.

## Output locations
- Default outputs go to `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin` and `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/lib`.
- The `dist/` layout is opt-in and only applies to targets that call
  `dist_set_role`. See `docs/guides/BUILD_DIST.md`.

## Generated metadata
Build number artifacts are generated by the `dom_update_build_number` target.
