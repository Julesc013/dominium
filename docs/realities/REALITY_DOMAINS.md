# Reality Domains

Status: canonical.
Scope: alternate reality domains as content packs.
Authority: canonical. All reality packs MUST follow this.

## Binding rules
- Reality domains MUST be expressed as optional content packs.
- Reality domains MUST declare fields, processes, and model families via schemas.
- Reality domains MUST be capability-resolved; no hardcoded paths or defaults.
- Multiple realities MAY coexist; precedence MUST be explicit in refinement plans.
- Removing a reality pack MUST NOT corrupt objective truth.

## Separation of truth and belief
- Objective truth remains singular; subjective projections may diverge.
- Knowledge artifacts MAY encode belief or doctrine without changing truth.
