# False Science

Status: canonical.
Scope: incorrect or non-empirical models and beliefs.
Authority: canonical. All false-science content MUST follow this.

## Binding rules
- False or outdated models MUST be represented as knowledge artifacts and model families.
- They MUST NOT replace objective truth or suppress other models by default.
- Institutions MAY enforce false models via data, not engine logic.
- Conflicting models MUST coexist with explicit precedence in refinement plans.
