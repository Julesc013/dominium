# Magic Is Data

Status: canonical.
Scope: magic as an optional reality pack.
Authority: canonical. All magic content MUST follow this.

## Binding rules
- Magic MUST be modeled as fields, processes, and model families defined in packs.
- Magic MUST be capability-resolved and MUST NOT require engine changes.
- Magic MUST NOT be privileged over other realities; it is data only.
- Removing the magic pack MUST degrade or disable dependent behavior explicitly.

## Epistemic gating
- Belief and knowledge artifacts MAY gate subjective refinement.
- Objective truth MUST NOT be modified by belief alone.
