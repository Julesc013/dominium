# Confidence Statement

Solid:
- Repo governance remains green (`scripts/ci/check_repox_rules.py` pass).
- Strict C89/C++98 build targets pass (`domino_engine`, `dominium_game`).
- Determinism and schema suites pass (`ctest -R determinism`, `ctest -R schema`).
- Inventory, marker scan, pack audit, and test-matrix artifacts are now regenerated by
  deterministic tooling with RepoX-compliant headers.
- No simulation semantics, process mutation rules, or authority boundaries were changed.

Provisional:
- `14/59` packs fail integrity validation and need scoped remediation.
- Stage-token surfaces still exist in appcore/schema/tooling and currently conflict with
  capability-only invariant wording; this needs governance reconciliation.
- `46` temporary stubs remain and require policy classification to prevent drift.
- Marker backlog (`49` TODO/FIXME/PLACEHOLDER hits) remains and should be reduced via
  scoped hygiene prompts.
