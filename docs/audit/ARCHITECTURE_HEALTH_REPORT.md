# Architecture Health Report (Worldgen)

Status: canonical.
Scope: worldgen and epistemic architecture health.
Authority: canonical. This report sets expectations for long-term stability.

## Stable guarantees
- Engine and game remain content-agnostic and zero-asset capable.
- Capability resolution is the only binding contract for content access.
- Objective truth is singular and immutable to epistemic processes.

## Intentionally flexible areas
- Model families are data-defined and open-ended.
- Refinement plans are additive and precedence-driven.
- Reality domains are optional and removable.

## Known limitations
- Tool outputs are metadata-only and do not perform simulation.
- Validation is conservative and may flag ambiguous precedence.
- Pack diffing is scope-based and does not infer real-world semantics.

## Explicit non-guarantees
- No promise of scientific realism without corresponding content packs.
- No guarantee of cross-pack semantic consistency without explicit precedence.
- No guarantee of subjective agreement between agents with different knowledge.
