# Doc ↔ Code Drift Report

This report lists documentation that explicitly references placeholders or
unimplemented behavior.

## Findings (examples)

- `docs/architecture/REPORT_GAME_ARCH_DECISIONS.md` contains TODOs for save format and UI placeholders.
- `docs/architecture/CHECKPOINTS.md` includes placeholder exploration parity items.
- `docs/ci/CI_ENFORCEMENT_MATRIX.md` contains placeholder entries for future checks.
- `docs/guides/IMPLEMENTATION_BACKLOG_*` contain open TODO placeholders.

These entries should be reviewed and either:
1) updated to match implemented behavior, or
2) explicitly archived if no longer applicable.

No doc content was modified in this pass.
