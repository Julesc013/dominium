# Package Specification (Placeholder)

This repository is mid-refactor into the Domino/Dominium layout. The
package/manifest specifications are being consolidated here.

TODO:
- Fold the legacy installer scripts (`scripts/packaging/`) and manifest format
  notes into this document.
- Define package metadata schema, dependency rules, and deterministic hashing.
- Align with the new module boundaries: domino.mod (engine-side packaging) and
  dominium.products (launcher/setup/game consumption).

For now see `docs/FORMATS/FORMAT_INSTALL_MANIFEST.md` for historical context.
