# What Players Can Do

Dominium is designed to support many styles of play. What you can do depends on the content packs you install, but you never need to learn the internals to enjoy it.

You can:

- Explore worlds that change over time.
- Build, combine, and inspect machines, systems, and structures.
- Run processes and see their consequences.
- Manage resources, logistics, and institutions.
- Create laws, policies, and constraints that shape outcomes.
- Observe, rewind, and replay history.
- Share your worlds and creations with others.

If you only want to play, you can. If you want to tinker, you can go deeper at your own pace.
