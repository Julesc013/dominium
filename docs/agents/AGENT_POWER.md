# AGENT POWER

Authority MUST be explicit, scoped, revocable, and process-mediated.
Authority grants, transfers, and revocations MUST be recorded with provenance.
Agents MUST NOT mutate state without authority; enforcement MUST occur through processes.
No agent or institution has implicit god mode unless explicitly granted by process.

Power systems MUST NOT assume human governance defaults.
Power systems MUST NOT rely on "AI magic" or privileged arbitration.
