# AGENT CONFLICT

Conflict MUST emerge from incompatible goals, authority disputes, and resource competition.
Agents and institutions MAY contest authority without a global arbiter by default.
Conflict resolution MUST be process-mediated and leave historical artifacts.
Collapse, fragmentation, and overthrow MUST be representable outcomes.

Conflict models MUST NOT assume human-centric narratives or player primacy.
Conflict models MUST NOT rely on "AI magic" or scripted outcomes.
