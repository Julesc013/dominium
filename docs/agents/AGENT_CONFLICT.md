# AGENT CONFLICT





Conflict MUST emerge from incompatible goals, authority disputes, and resource competition.


Agents and institutions MAY contest authority without a global arbiter by default.


Conflict resolution MUST be process-mediated and leave historical artifacts.


Collapse, fragmentation, and overthrow MUST be representable outcomes.





Conflict models MUST NOT assume human-centric narratives or player primacy.


Conflict models MUST NOT rely on "AI magic" or scripted outcomes.
