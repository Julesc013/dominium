# AGENT INSTITUTIONS

Institutions MUST be modeled as agents with stable identity and explicit authority scopes.
Institutions MUST be created, transformed, and terminated only via processes with provenance.
Institutions MUST hold goals, capabilities, and epistemic state and MUST act only through processes.
Institutions MUST NOT be special-cased factions, NPC systems, or UI-only entities.

Institutions MUST NOT assume human defaults or player intent.
Institutions MUST NOT rely on "AI magic" or hidden coordination logic.
