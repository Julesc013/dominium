Macro-history MUST be aggregated from agent and institution events.
History MUST be able to contain multiple narratives, propaganda, and loss of records.
History MUST NOT be treated as objective truth; objective state remains separate.
Aggregation MUST be deterministic given the same inputs and policy.

History systems MUST NOT assume human historiography defaults.
History systems MUST NOT rely on "AI magic" or authoring shortcuts.
