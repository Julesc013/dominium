# AGENT MEMORY





Agent memory MUST be finite, lossy, and decaying.


Memory MUST support acquisition, decay, loss, and distortion.


Forgetting MUST be time-based and interference-based, with institutional memory distinct from individual memory.


No infinite or perfect recall is allowed.





Memory systems MUST NOT assume human memory patterns or player persistence.


Memory systems MUST NOT depend on "AI magic" to preserve or restore knowledge.
