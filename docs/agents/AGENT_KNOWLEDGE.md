# AGENT KNOWLEDGE

Agents MUST operate on subjective knowledge, not objective truth, by default.
Beliefs MUST be confidence-weighted, time-scoped, and allowed to be wrong or contradictory.
Belief updates MUST occur only through epistemic processes (observe, measure, infer, hear, forget, distort).
There MUST be no direct "truth sync" from the objective world state.

Knowledge systems MUST NOT assume human perception or player insight.
Knowledge systems MUST NOT rely on "AI magic" or privileged omniscience.
