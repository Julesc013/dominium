# SIM/SENSE (Sensing)

Deterministic sensing/sampling scaffolding.

## Responsibilities
- Define interfaces for sampling fields and emitting observations.
- Require canonical ordering and bounded per-tick work.

## Non-responsibilities / prohibited
- No platform sensors, IO, or non-deterministic sampling.

## Spec
See `docs/SPEC_FIELDS_EVENTS.md`, `docs/SPEC_PACKETS.md`, and `docs/SPEC_DETERMINISM.md`.
