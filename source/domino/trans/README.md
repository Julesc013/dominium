# TRANS (Transforms / Topology)

TRANS owns topology/transform representations that connect STRUCT and world
anchoring, compiled from authored data.

## Boundaries
- Deterministic storage and canonical ordering.
- No platform APIs; no rendering geometry as authoritative state.

## Submodules (scaffold)
- `compile/` deterministic authoring → compiled artifact pipeline.

## Spec
See `docs/SPEC_TRANS_STRUCT_DECOR.md`, `docs/SPEC_POSE_AND_ANCHORS.md`,
and `docs/SPEC_DETERMINISM.md`.
