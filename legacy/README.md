# Legacy (Archived)

Status: archived.

This directory contains legacy artifacts kept for historical reference and
compatibility investigation. It is not part of mainline builds.

Replacement policy:

- Prefer canonical contracts and current implementations.
- Reference legacy content only when documenting migration or compatibility.
