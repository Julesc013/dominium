# org.dominium.core.signals.basic

Purpose: Minimal signal fields, interfaces, and process families for testing and modding.

Maturity: STRUCTURAL

Capabilities:
- org.dominium.core.signals

Contents:
- `data/signals.json` (signal fields, interfaces, noise/latency profiles)
- `data/fab_pack.json` (signal process families)

Notes:
- This pack is abstract and non-physical.
- All computation is data-driven and sampled discretely.
