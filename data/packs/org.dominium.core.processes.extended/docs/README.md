# org.dominium.core.processes.extended

Maturity: PARAMETRIC

Purpose: Provide process families that stress multi-input/output chains,
energy inefficiency, waste byproducts, and probabilistic failure envelopes.

Capabilities:
- org.dominium.core.processes
- org.dominium.core.processes.extended

Contents:
- `data/fab_pack.json` (extended process families)

Notes:
- Required instruments and standards are referenced but remain declarative.
- Yield and failure maps are intentionally sparse and unit-tagged.
