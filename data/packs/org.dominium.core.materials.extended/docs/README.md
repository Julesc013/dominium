# org.dominium.core.materials.extended

Maturity: PARAMETRIC

Purpose: Extend the abstract material library with richer trait bundles that
stress wide ranges, conflicting traits, and sensitivity/degradation parameters.

Capabilities:
- org.dominium.core.materials
- org.dominium.core.materials.extended

Contents:
- `data/fab_pack.json` (extended material trait bundles)

Notes:
- Materials are declarative and non-realistic.
- Traits and failure parameters are unit-tagged and safe to deepen via
  additional parameters.
