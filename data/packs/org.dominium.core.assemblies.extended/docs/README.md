# org.dominium.core.assemblies.extended

Maturity: STRUCTURAL

Purpose: Provide complex assembly graphs that stress nesting depth, shared
subassemblies, cycles, and multiple hosted processes.

Capabilities:
- org.dominium.core.assemblies.extended

Contents:
- `data/fab_pack.json` (extended assemblies)

Notes:
- Assemblies depend on extended parts, interfaces, and processes.
- Some graphs are intentionally edge-case heavy to surface refusals.
