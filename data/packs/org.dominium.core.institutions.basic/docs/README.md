# org.dominium.core.institutions.basic

Purpose: Minimal institutional archetypes (inspector, standards body, court, regulator).

Maturity: STRUCTURAL.

Notes:
- Data-only. No authority is implied without processes and law packs.
- Institutions reference authority tokens and capabilities but grant no code paths.
