# org.dominium.core.parts.extended

Maturity: STRUCTURAL

Purpose: Provide parts and interfaces that stress asymmetry, multi-interface
designs, capacity mismatches, and tolerance edge cases.

Capabilities:
- org.dominium.core.interfaces
- org.dominium.core.interfaces.extended
- org.dominium.core.parts
- org.dominium.core.parts.extended

Contents:
- `data/fab_pack.json` (extended interfaces and parts)

Notes:
- Interfaces are declared here to test directionality and degradation flags.
- Parts reference extended materials and are intended for assembly stress tests.
